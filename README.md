Cornerhouse data linked to TheMovieDb

A utility that aims to link together data from that realeased by
[Cornerhouse](http://www.cornerhouse.org/) with
[themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

This project was created for the [AND film data
hack](http://www.andfestival.org.uk/blog/and-hack1-datasets/).


## Examples of this data in action

### Linking to other data sources

In the `films` data there is the `imdb_id`, which is its id in on
[IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/).

This can be used to link it back to IMDb

    http://www.imdb.com/title/<imdb_id>/

e.g.
[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185937/](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185937/)

Or to the Rotten Tomatoes API (you will need to [sign up for an API
key](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/member/register))

    http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=<imdb_id_without_the_tt_prefix>&apikey=<your_api_key>

e.g.[http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0130827&apikey=<your_api_key>&_prettyprint=true](http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0130827&apikey=<your_api_key>&_prettyprint=true)
